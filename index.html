                <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>

                <div class="two_third">
                    <p>I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) of Information Systems and Business Analytics in the Department of Information and Decision Sciences at the College of Business Administration, University of Illinois at Chicago. Previously, I was a Research Staff Member at IBM Research. 

                    <p>My research is motivated by and contributes to applications in Social Informatics, Civic Informatics, Digital Platforms, and Human-AI interactions. My research employs data mining, econometrics, and lab & field experimentation to reason about human behavior from large-scale digital footprints. My research has been published in various leading journals, including Information Systems Research (ISR), MIS Quarterly (MISQ), INFORMS Journal on Computing (JOC), Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), ACM Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ), as well as premier computer science venues, including ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI), AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), and AAAI Conference on Artificial Intengenllence (AAAI). My work has been generously supported by multiple grants from the Marketing Science Institute, Nvidia, and Amazon.</p> 

                    <p>My research has won a number of best paper awards and nominations, including International Conference on Information Systems (2021), Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (2021), ​the Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems (2018, 2020), the Conference on information systems and technology (2017, 2023),  INFORMS Annual Conference  (2017, 2022), the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing (2013). My dissertation work also received a <a href="files/president-crow-letter.png">Letter of Commendation</a> from the University President of Arizona State University. My work and opinions have been cited by numerous national and international outlets in the popular press, including LSE Business Review, The Verge, ABC News, WIRED magazine, Huffington Post, PBS, etc. My research also generated two patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
                    </p>
					
                    <p>I have been fortunate to have spent time at various inspirational institutions at different points in my career. I received my Ph.D in 2014 from Arizona State University. I also did a few fun and fruitful internships at Microsoft Research and Avaya Labs Research. 
                    </p>
