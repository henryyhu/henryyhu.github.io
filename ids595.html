                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>With the rise of various social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.), people can share content, opinions, insights, experiences, perspectives, and media themselves, as well as producing many new media. Social networks emerge with the pervasive use of social media. In this seminar, we will briefly introduce the background of social computing including concepts and principles such as small world, random networks, scale-free networks, laws, and distributions (normal distribution, Zipfâ€™s law, power-law), search in networks, propagation and diffusion of influence, social recommendation, collective wisdom. We will learn what representative data collection techniques are, and how to use collected data to help achieve tasks such as recommendation, identifying key performance indicators, etc. We will study issues like public opinion, sentiment analysis, and reputation. This course aims to introduce the state-of-the-art developments in participatory social media techniques, social networks and analysis, network analysis and graph theory, link analysis, and social media mining, to study emerging problems, and to learn innovatively applying multidisciplinary approaches to problem-solving. The ultimate goal is to sharpen problem-solving and critical thinking skills of our graduate students and prepare them with this unique set of expertise for the increasing demands in IT industry and for in-depth advanced research.</p>
